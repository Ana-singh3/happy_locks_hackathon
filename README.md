# happy_locks_hackathon
In March 2024, I participated in CODE4CHANGE, a 48-hour hackathon at YANTRA'24, where I developed a fully functional and responsive website, HappyLocks.com. This website aims to promote the use of tetra packs for shampoo packaging, aligning with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
